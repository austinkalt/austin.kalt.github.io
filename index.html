         <p id="intro">  Hitting a baseball is considered to be one of the most difficult things to do in professional sports. To some, it may seem very easy by just watching a Major League Baseball game, but in reality, the top hitters in the sport are only successful about three times out of ten. 
            <br>
            <br>
            There are a combination of things that makes hitting an MLB pitcher so tough. The mixture of velocity, movement and pitch sequencing, often leaves hitters guessing when they're at the plate. Here's a look at five of the most dominant pitchers and a focus on their most effective pitch that caused issues for opposing batters all season long.

      <p id="devin"> In this shortened season, Devin Williams proved to be one of the most dominant relievers in the league. The most impressive part of his success was that he did this all in his rookie season. This year, Williams faced 100 batters and allowed just one earned run. A huge part of his success was because of how effective his changeup was. The changeup is an off-speed pitch that is used to mess with batter’s timing, which Williams found a ton of success doing. The combination of his high 90s (mph) fastball and wicked changeup, resulted in him becoming the first reliever since 2011 to win the Rookie of the Year award. This chart displays all of the at-bats that Williams threw his changeup and all of the outcomes, according to <a href="https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/devin-williams-642207?stats=statcast-r-pitching-mlb" target="_blank"> Baseball Savant. </a>

      <p id="tyler"> Tyler Glasnow has one of the most effective curveballs in the MLB mainly because he relies heavily on mixing it up with his overpowering fastball. Glasnow’s average velocity on his fastball was 96.9 mph, while his curveball was 82.4 mph. This huge difference in speed causes a ton of problems for the timing of opposing batters. Glasnow’s curveball produced one of the highest whiff percentages in the league at 52.8. Like the other charts, this one shows all of the at-bats where Glasnow used his curve and all of the outcomes, according to <a href="https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/tyler-glasnow-607192?stats=statcast-r-pitching-mlb" target="_blank"> Baseball Savant. </a>

      <p id="shane"> In the 2020 season, Shane Bieber secured the Cy Young award for the American League as he dominated opposing batters all season. Bieber throws five different pitches and they have all proven to be very dominant. But one pitch that Bieber found the most success with was his curveball. He threw this pitch 325 times last season, producing a 51.5% whiff percentage and a .095 batting average. This chart shows all of his curveballs this season and the outcomes that resulted from it this season, according to <a href="https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/shane-bieber-669456" target="_blank"> Baseball Savant. </a>

      <p id="framber"> Framber Valdez has a four pitch repertoire, but his curveball proved to be his most devastating of them all. A curveball is another variant of an off-speed pitch that drops and dives toward the ground as it approaches the batter. In recent years, baseball has become extremely analytical and it has sparked a ton of new advanced statistics. The combination of traditional and advanced stats has resulted in a ton of information to really convey how dominant players are. One stat that sticks out for Valdez’ curveball is whiff percentage, which is the percent that the batter swings and misses the ball. This season, Valdez threw his curveball 351 times and recorded a whiff percentage of 41.9%. This chart displays all of the at-bats that Valdez threw his curveball and all of the outcomes, according to <a href="https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/framber-valdez-664285?stats=statcast-r-pitching-mlb" target="_blank"> Baseball Savant. </a>

      <p id="trevor"> Moving on from the off-speed pitches, Trevor Bauer had one of the most dominant, well-rounded pitch arsenals this season, but his fastball was one of his most important. His dominance translated to him winning his first career Cy Young Award, which is awarded to the best pitcher from each league.His fastball averaged a speed of 93.5 mph. When Bauer threw his fastball, opposing batters had a batting average of .140. This number is determined by the number of hits totaled divided by the number of at-bats. In this chart, this shows all the at-bats that Bauer used his fastball and outcomes, according to <a href="https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/trevor-bauer-545333" target="_blank"> Baseball Savant. </a>
